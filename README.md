# Projects in UC Davis Biostatistics Courses

Here are a collection of graduate-level biostatistics projects completed during my time at UC Davis while completing my MS in Applied Mathematics. 

## Survival Analysis for Chlorhexidine Gluconate Protocols of *Staphyloccus aureus* Infection Treatment [Bst 222 Midterm Project].

*It’s well understood that the primary source of infections of burn wounds by severely burned patients are the
source of extended hospital stays. Within hospital burn units, of major concern are nosocomial infections, or
infections occurring within a clinical environment, which can happen during surgical procedures removing
wound eschar. The following survival analysis of burn patients is resulting from a study conducted from 1983
to 1985 introducing a protocol utilizing an antimicrobial detergent with 4 percent chlorhexidine gluconate
(Hibiclens) substituting standard total body bathing with bar soap (Dial), for which the total body bathing
with bar soap was started with decontamination with povidoine-iodine (Betadine)...*

## Statistical Prognoses of Primary Biliary Cholangitis with Survival Analysis [Bst 222 Final Project].

*Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease that can develop into primary sclerosing
cholangitis and ultimately primary biliary cirrhosis where the small bile ducts in the liver become damaged,
scarred and destroyed, respectively. This is a serious condition that can certainly lead to death if left untreated
and mismanaged. Between January 1974 and May 1984, 424 patients were seen at the Mayo Clinic with
follow-ups extended to April 30, 1988. The report presented aims to rigorously identify factors of increased
risk of mortality for those afflicted with PBC...*

## Statistical Intersectionality of Male Occupational Inheritance [Bst 223 Midterm Project].

*Intersectionality is the idea that social identities such as race, class and ethnicity, intersect to impact an
individual’s privileges and social experiences (e.g., discrimination, biases). Within the broad scope of questions
that can be characterized as problems of intersectionality, a particular question of interest is male occupational
inheritance: how does an individuals socioeconomic history affect his current occupation, and effectively his
economic wealth. With respect to this question we present a case study on male occupational inheritance
from data made available by the Data and Program Library Service at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
utilizing the generalized linear model...*


## Pandemic Era Policing: A Mode of Felony Arrests in California [(Bst 223 Final Project].

*Various news outlets have been reporting an increase in crime across the nation [1,2,3]. California in particular
represents a large portion of these crimes. With soft-on-crime policies naturally favored by the democraticmajority state government, 
and the Defund the Police Movement of recent years due to public outrage due
to events such as the George Floyd incident, law enforcement agencies have developed poor public image.
Alarmingly, 2021 marks the first year where there has been a decrease in law enforcement personnel in police
and sheriff departments across California, dropping to levels before 2017 [4]. With all of these recent trends a
natural question is to ask how felony arrests are being made in recent years by law enforcement in California
on the basis of social factors. We study this question with the generalized linear model...*
