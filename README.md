# Projects in UC Davis Biostatistics Courses

Here are a collection of graduate-level biostatistics projects completed during my time at UC Davis while completing my MS in Applied Mathematics. 
All the code for each project is included in the appendix section of the corresponding reports.
Below are excerpts from the introductions of the project reports. 

## 1. Survival Analysis for Chlorhexidine Gluconate Protocols of *Staphyloccus aureus* Infection Treatment [Bst-222-Midterm-Project.pdf]

*It’s well understood that the primary source of infections of burn wounds by severely burned patients are the
source of extended hospital stays. Within hospital burn units, of major concern are nosocomial infections, or
infections occurring within a clinical environment, which can happen during surgical procedures removing
wound eschar. The following survival analysis of burn patients is resulting from a study conducted from 1983
to 1985 introducing a protocol utilizing an antimicrobial detergent with 4 percent chlorhexidine gluconate
(Hibiclens) substituting standard total body bathing with bar soap (Dial), for which the total body bathing
with bar soap was started with decontamination with povidoine-iodine (Betadine)...*

## 2. Statistical Prognoses of Primary Biliary Cholangitis with Survival Analysis [Bst-222-Final-Project.pdf]

*Primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease that can develop into primary sclerosing
cholangitis and ultimately primary biliary cirrhosis where the small bile ducts in the liver become damaged,
scarred and destroyed, respectively. This is a serious condition that can certainly lead to death if left untreated
and mismanaged. Between January 1974 and May 1984, 424 patients were seen at the Mayo Clinic with
follow-ups extended to April 30, 1988. The report presented aims to rigorously identify factors of increased
risk of mortality for those afflicted with PBC...*

## 3. Statistical Intersectionality of Male Occupational Inheritance [Bst-223-Midterm-Project.pdf]

*Intersectionality is the idea that social identities such as race, class and ethnicity, intersect to impact an
individual’s privileges and social experiences (e.g., discrimination, biases). Within the broad scope of questions
that can be characterized as problems of intersectionality, a particular question of interest is male occupational
inheritance: how does an individuals socioeconomic history affect his current occupation, and effectively his
economic wealth. With respect to this question we present a case study on male occupational inheritance
from data made available by the Data and Program Library Service at the University of Wisconsin-Madison
utilizing the generalized linear model...*


## 4. Pandemic Era Policing: A Model of Felony Arrests in California [Bst-223-Final-Project.pdf]

*Various news outlets have been reporting an increase in crime across the nation [1,2,3]. California in particular
represents a large portion of these crimes. With soft-on-crime policies naturally favored by the democratic majority state government, 
and the Defund the Police Movement of recent years due to public outrage due
to events such as the George Floyd incident, law enforcement agencies have developed poor public image.
Alarmingly, 2021 marks the first year where there has been a decrease in law enforcement personnel in police
and sheriff departments across California, dropping to levels before 2017 [4]. With all of these recent trends a
natural question is to ask how felony arrests are being made in recent years by law enforcement in California
on the basis of social factors. We study this question with the generalized linear model...*

## 5. Revisiting Laser Tattoo Removal Complications on the Formerly Incarcerated and Reformed [Bst-224-Final-Project.pdf]

*[A revised analysis utilized generalized estimating equation GLM for longitudinal data, correctly incorporating correlated data.] This project revisits an older analysis that I completed while I was an undergraduate studying pure math and statistics. The original project was a joint collaboration with a nonprofit, Homeboy Industries, which is the largest gang rehabilitation program in the United States, and headquartered in Los Angeles, providing job training, employment and most important to former gang members, tattoo removal...*

## 6. Employment Prestige After Biochemistry PhD: An Observational Study with Causal Inference Analysis [Bst-250-Final-Project.pdf]

*Academic job markets are known to be notoriously competitive with thousands of PhD students
graduating each year in with science and engineering doctorates in the US [1]. In fact, this rate has
only been increasing with no sign of decline. Yet, the number of academic positions, in particular
postdoctoral positions, are not growing at a proportionate rate with most seeking industry position
(i.e., academic job market is incredibly competitive). In this project we explore what activities if
any have any causal effect on academic job market outcomes for those seeking academic careers in
science and engineering.*

## 7. A Phase III randomized controlled trial of progressive resistance exercise training on shoulder dysfunction caused by spinal accessory neurapraxia/neurectomy in head and neck cancer survivors. [Bst-225-Group-Project.pdf]

*[Mock clinical trial study design protocol document. A group project with myself as mock PI and team leader, Brittany Lemmon, Paulo Rocha, Xi Chen and Juliana Mendez.]
 Progressive Resistance Exercise Training (PRET) has been known as a promising
intervention in addressing shoulder dysfunction in head and neck cancer survivors who have experienced
spinal accessory neuropraxia or neurectomy. We want to do a phase III randomized controlled trial to
investigate how PRET will affect the shoulder dysfunction caused by spinal accessory nerves...*
